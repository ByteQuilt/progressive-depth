# Contributing to Progressive Depth

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Use the format.** The best contribution is adopting Progressive Depth
  on your own blog and sharing what you learn.
- **Report issues.** If something in the component or spec doesn't work
  as expected, open an issue.
- **Improve documentation.** Clarifications, examples, and guides are
  always welcome.
- **Build integrations.** Adapters for other frameworks (Vue, Svelte,
  Astro components) would be great additions.
